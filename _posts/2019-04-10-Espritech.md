### Smart industry and artificial intelligence
Medical image data is an important part of medical data. More than 90% of medical data is image data in terms of quantity. From the data generation equipment, medical image data such as CT, X-ray, MRI, and PET are included. According to statistics, the annual growth rate of medical imaging data is 63%, while the annual growth rate of radiologists is only 2%. The supply gap of radiologists is very large.

The combination of artificial intelligence technology and medical imaging is expected to 
alleviate such problems. The application of artificial intelligence technology in medical 
imaging mainly refers to the rapid reading and intelligent diagnosis of medical images by 
computer vision technology. The application of artificial intelligence in medical imaging 
is mainly divided into two parts: one is the perceptual data, that is, the medical image is
analyzed by image recognition technology to obtain effective information; the second is data
learning and training, through deep learning of massive image data and clinical Diagnose
the data and continuously train the model to master its diagnostic capabilities. 
At present, the combination of artificial intelligence technology and medical imaging 
diagnosis includes lung cancer examination, sugar net fundus examination, esophageal
cancer examination, nuclear medicine examination and pathological examination of some 
diseases. The steps of judging the benign malignancy of lung tumors by artificial 
intelligence technology include: data collection, data preprocessing, image segmentation,
lung nodule marking, model training, and classification prediction.

We provide our customer with professional import solutions for agricultural and fishery 
products. Along with the continued growth of the global economy, the number of new 
procurement locations, imports and the number of borders that goods have crossed throughout 
the transportation process have increased accordingly. As the supply chain continues to 
become more global in nature, the number of borders that goods cross in the transportation 
process not only increases the complexity of cargo transportation, but also increases the 
variety of government regulations and regulations that companies need to follow.

If your company's business involves importing goods, then you can understand what is involved
from the purchase order to the final delivery. Only when correct and timely data is fully 
shared across the supply chain and all trading partners is it possible to achieve cargo 
transportation throughout the global supply chain. By providing accurate and necessary data
to jurisdictions with jurisdiction to facilitate smooth transactions between trading 
partners, the speed of the supply chain is increased and the risk of trade interruptions
is reduced.
